    <h1>The Truth of Video Games</h1>
    <p> The gamer stereotype states that playing video games make you fat, lazy, stupid and other such negative ideals. The truth is almost none of these stereotypes are actually correct. Improved attention, quicker thinking, improved visual sensitivity, job related skills, these are just a few of the benefits that video games bring.
    <p> The most obvious benefits of playing video games include those that boost thinking abilities. Different video game features affect different parts of the brain, for example some RPGs require players to pay strong attention so nothing important is missed in dialogue, story or notes as these may become important as the game progresses. Some games do this similarly but with other elements, for example there are games which require the player to watch something carefully, follow it with their eye, or even remember the location of something, thus improving visual and memory skills. Of course there are far more ways video games improve one's abilities, these are just some of the more known ones.
    <p> Another key benefit of playing video games is how they relieve pain, both physically and emotionally. Studies have shown that patients struck by illness, both minor and major, find relief in pain and stress by playing games, they help occupy the mind and keep it busy and ignoring the pain. This is the same effect that occurs with sufferers of depression, anxiety and stress. Video games stimulate the release of endorphins, a chemical in the brain which is associated with happiness.
    <p> An up and coming benefit of video games is the way they keep the body and the mind healthy. In recent years games have been released which act as a daily brain exercise with new challenges each day. This is very popular with the elderly as they try to keep their minds active during retirement. Even more recently was the release and evolution of motion controls, a key contender being Microsoft's Xbox Kinect. Games have been releasing for the kinect since its initial release which aims to get people up and moving in a fun and enjoyable way.
    <p> These are only a few of the many benefits of video games. Join the social network to find out more, join the community, and get playing.
